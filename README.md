# Rope and Cloth Simulation Project

## Overview

This project implements a rope and cloth simulation using the mass-spring model. The simulation includes the effects of gravity, damping, and collision detection. The tasks are structured to progressively build up the simulation, starting from simple constraints on connecting ropes to more complex cloth simulation and collision handling.

       "tasks": [
         {
           "label": "Build",
           "type": "shell",
           "command": "cmake --build build",
           "group": {
             "kind": "build",
             "isDefault": true
           }
         },
         {
           "label": "Run",
           "

```json
           "type": "shell",
           "command": "${workspaceFolder}/build/RopeSimulation",
           "group": {
             "kind": "test",
             "isDefault": true
           },
           "dependsOn": "Build"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

4. **Configure CMake Settings:**
   - Create a `settings.json` file inside the `.vscode` directory with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "cmake.configureOnOpen": true,
       "cmake.generator": "MinGW Makefiles"
     }
     ```

5. **Configure Debugging (Optional):**
   - Create a `launch.json` file inside the `.vscode` directory with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Debug",

   - Open the CMake Tools sidebar and click `Configure`.
   - After configuring, click `Build`.

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
   - Select `Run Task` and choose `Run`.
   - This will build and run your project, displaying the simulation window.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Implementing Mass and Spring Classes
- **Mass Class:** Represents a mass point in the simulation. Includes attributes for position, velocity, and mass.
- **Spring Class:** Represents a spring connecting two mass points. Implements Hooke's law to calculate the force between connected masses.

### Task 2: Explicit/Semi-Implicit Eulerâ€™s Law
- **Explicit Euler Method:** Updates positions and velocities directly using current acceleration.
- **Semi-Implicit Euler Method:** Updates velocity first using current acceleration and then updates position using the new velocity.
- **Damping:** Adds a damping force proportional to the velocity to simulate energy loss.

### Task 3: Verlet Integration Method
- **Verlet Integration:** A numerical method that provides better stability for simulations by using both past and current positions to calculate the new position.

### Task 4: Cloth Simulation
- **Cloth Mesh:** Represents a grid of interconnected mass points. Each point is connected to its neighbors by springs.
- **Collision Detection:** Implements collision detection to prevent mass points from penetrating each other or external objects.

### Task 5: Optimization and Improvements
- **Performance Optimization:** Techniques to improve simulation performance, such as spatial partitioning to reduce the number of collision checks.
- **Additional Forces:** Incorporates additional forces such as wind or user interaction.

## Running the Simulations

- To run the explicit Euler method simulation: Execute `./task2_1`.
- To run the semi-implicit Euler method simulation: Execute `./task2_2`.
- Adjust values in the configuration files (`task2_1.cpp` and `task2_2.cpp`) to observe different behaviors.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of physical simulations using C++ and modern libraries. By following the tasks, you can progressively build a comprehensive simulation framework capable of handling complex interactions in a realistic manner.
